The release notes covering the history of the core git commands can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/git/git/tree/HEAD/Documentation/RelNotes\">in the Git project</a>.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://git-scm.com/\">http://git-scm.com/</a> for further details about Git including ports to other operating systems. Git for Windows is hosted at <a href=\"https://gitforwindows.org/\">https://gitforwindows.org/</a>.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"known-issues\" class=\"collapsible\">Known issues</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li>On Windows 10 before 1703, or when Developer Mode is turned off, special permissions are required when cloning repositories with symbolic links, therefore support for symbolic links is disabled by default. Use <code>git clone -c core.symlinks=true &lt;URL&gt;</code> to enable it, see details <a href=\"https://gitforwindows.org/symbolic-links\">here</a>.</li>\n<li>If configured to use Plink, you will have to connect with <a href=\"http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/\">putty</a> first and accept the host key.</li>\n<li>Some console programs, most notably non-MSYS2 Python, PHP, Node and OpenSSL, interact correctly with MinTTY only when called through <code>winpty</code> (e.g. the Python console needs to be started as <code>winpty python</code> instead of just <code>python</code>).</li>\n<li><p>If you specify command-line options starting with a slash, POSIX-to-Windows path conversion will kick in converting e.g. \"<code>/usr/bin/bash.exe</code>\" to \"<code>C:\\Program Files\\Git\\usr\\bin\\bash.exe</code>\". When that is not desired -- e.g. \"<code>--upload-pack=/opt/git/bin/git-upload-pack</code>\" or \"<code>-L/regex/</code>\" -- you need to set the environment variable <code>MSYS_NO_PATHCONV</code> temporarily, like so:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><code>MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 git blame -L/pathconv/ msys2_path_conv.cc</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can double the first slash to avoid POSIX-to-Windows path conversion, e.g. \"<code>//usr/bin/bash.exe</code>\".</p></li>\n<li>Windows drives are normally recognized within the POSIX path as <code>/c/path/to/dir/</code> where <code>/c/</code> (or appropriate drive letter) is equivalent to the <code>C:\\</code> Windows prefix to the <code>\\path\\to\\dir</code>. If this is not recognized, revert to the <code>C:\\path\\to\\dir</code> Windows style.</li>\n<li>Git for Windows will not allow commits containing DOS-style truncated 8.3-format filenames ending with a tilde and digit, such as <code>mydocu~1.txt</code>. A workaround is to call <code>git config core.protectNTFS false</code>, which is not advised. Instead, add a rule to .gitignore to ignore the file(s), or rename the file(s).</li>\n<li>Many Windows programs (including the Windows Explorer) have problems with directory trees nested so deeply that the absolute path is longer than 260 characters. Therefore, Git for Windows refuses to check out such files by default. You can overrule this default by setting <code>core.longPaths</code>, e.g. <code>git clone -c core.longPaths=true ...</code>.</li>\n<li>Some commands are not yet supported on Windows and excluded from the installation.</li>\n<li>As Git for Windows is shipped without Python support, <code>git p4</code> (which is backed by a Python script) is not supported.</li>\n<li>The Quick Launch icon will only be installed for the user running setup (typically the Administrator). This is a technical restriction and will not change.</li>\n<li>Git command hints are designed for a POSIX shell, this can lead to issues when using them <strong>as is</strong> in non-POSIX shells like PowerShell, <a href=\"https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/2785\">as is the case in this ticket</a>.</li>\n<li>When pushing via the <code>git://</code> protocol, Git for Windows may hang indefinitely.

When writing a config entry, values with a trailing CR are not quoted, causing the CR to be lost when the config is later read.  When initializing a submodule, if the submodule path contains a trailing CR, the altered path is read resulting in the submodule being checked out to an incorrect location.

The Git client does not perform sufficient validation of the advertised bundles, which allows the remote side to perform protocol injection. This protocol injection can cause the client to write the fetched bundle to a location controlled by the adversary.

The release notes covering the history of the core git commands can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/git/git/tree/HEAD/Documentation/RelNotes\">in the Git project</a>.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://git-scm.com/\">http://git-scm.com/</a> for further details about Git including ports to other operating systems. Git for Windows is hosted at <a href=\"https://gitforwindows.org/\">https://gitforwindows.org/</a>.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"known-issues\" class=\"collapsible\">Known issues</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li>On Windows 10 before 1703, or when Developer Mode is turned off, special permissions are required when cloning repositories with symbolic links, therefore support for symbolic links is disabled by default. Use <code>git clone -c core.symlinks=true &lt;URL&gt;</code> to enable it, see details <a href=\"https://gitforwindows.org/symbolic-links\">here</a>.</li>\n<li>If configured to use Plink, you will have to connect with <a href=\"http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/\">putty</a> first and accept the host key.</li>\n<li>Some console programs, most notably non-MSYS2 Python, PHP, Node and OpenSSL, interact correctly with MinTTY only when called through <code>winpty</code> (e.g. the Python console needs to be started as <code>winpty python</code> instead of just <code>python</code>).</li>\n<li><p>If you specify command-line options starting with a slash, POSIX-to-Windows path conversion will kick in converting e.g. \"<code>/usr/bin/bash.exe</code>\" to \"<code>C:\\Program Files\\Git\\usr\\bin\\bash.exe</code>\". When that is not desired -- e.g. \"<code>--upload-pack=/opt/git/bin/git-upload-pack</code>\" or \"<code>-L/regex/</code>\" -- you need to set the environment variable <code>MSYS_NO_PATHCONV</code> temporarily, like so:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><code>MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 git blame -L/pathconv/ msys2_path_conv.cc</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can double the first slash to avoid POSIX-to-Windows path conversion, e.g. \"<code>//usr/bin/bash.exe</code>\".</p></li>\n<li>Windows drives are normally recognized within the POSIX path as <code>/c/path/to/dir/</code> where <code>/c/</code> (or appropriate drive letter) is equivalent to the <code>C:\\</code> Windows prefix to the <code>\\path\\to\\dir</code>. If this is not recognized, revert to the <code>C:\\path\\to\\dir</code> Windows style.</li>\n<li>Git for Windows will not allow commits containing DOS-style truncated 8.3-format filenames ending with a tilde and digit, such as <code>mydocu~1.txt</code>. A workaround is to call <code>git config core.protectNTFS false</code>, which is not advised. Instead, add a rule to .gitignore to ignore the file(s), or rename the file(s).</li>\n<li>Many Windows programs (including the Windows Explorer) have problems with directory trees nested so deeply that the absolute path is longer than 260 characters. Therefore, Git for Windows refuses to check out such files by default. You can overrule this default by setting <code>core.longPaths</code>, e.g. <code>git clone -c core.longPaths=true ...</code>.</li>\n<li>Some commands are not yet supported on Windows and excluded from the installation.</li>\n<li>As Git for Windows is shipped without Python support, <code>git p4</code> (which is backed by a Python script) is not supported.</li>\n<li>The Quick Launch icon will only be installed for the user running setup (typically the Administrator). This is a technical restriction and will not change.</li>\n<li>Git command hints are designed for a POSIX shell, this can lead to issues when using them <strong>as is</strong> in non-POSIX shells like PowerShell, <a href=\"https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/2785\">as is the case in this ticket</a>.</li>\n<li>When pushing via the <code>git://</code> protocol, Git for Windows may hang indefinitely. The last console output in this case is typically <code>Writing objects: 100%</code>. As a workaround, disabling side-band via <code>git config sendpack.sideband false</code> should address this, at the cost of showing remote errors late (or not at all). No one is working on this; for more details, or to contribute a fix, see issue <a href=\"https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/907\">#907</a> (closed unless/until there is activity).</li>\n<li><p>Git for Windows executables linked to <code>msys-2.0.dll</code> are not compatible with Mandatory ASLR and may crash if system-wide Mandatory ASLR is enabled in Windows Exploit protection. A workaround is to disable ASLR for all executables in <code>C:\\Program Files\\Git\\usr\\bin</code>, run in administrator powershell (replace <code>$_.Name</code> with <code>$_</code> to use full path to executable instead of name):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><code>Get-Item -Path \"C:\\Program Files\\Git\\usr\\bin\\*.exe\" | %{ Set-ProcessMitigation -Name $_.Name -Disable ForceRelocateImages }</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can disable Mandatory ASLR completely in Windows Exploit protection.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Should you encounter other problems, please first search <a href=\"https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues\">the bug tracker</a> (also look at the closed issues) and <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/git-for-windows\">the mailing list</a>, chances are that the problem was reported already.

When writing a config entry, values with a trailing CR are not quoted, causing the CR to be lost when the config is later read.  When initializing a submodule, if the submodule path contains a trailing CR, the altered path is read resulting in the submodule being checked out to an incorrect location. If a symlink exists that points the altered path to the submodule hooks directory, and the submodule contains an executable post-checkout hook, the script may be unintentionally executed after checkout.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-m98c-vgpc-9655\"><strong>CVE-2025-48385</strong></a>, Git: When cloning a repository Git knows to optionally fetch a bundle advertised by the remote server, which allows the server-side to offload parts of the clone to a CDN. The Git client does not perform sufficient validation of the advertised bundles, which allows the remote side to perform protocol injection. This protocol injection can cause the client to write the fetched bundle to a location controlled by the adversary. The fetched content is fully controlled by the server, which can in the worst case lead to arbitrary code execution.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-4v56-3xvj-xvfr\"><strong>CVE-2025-48386</strong></a>, Git: The wincred credential helper uses a static buffer (<code>target</code>) as a unique key for storing and comparing against internal storage.

Git for Windows is hosted at <a href=\"https://gitforwindows.org/\">https://gitforwindows.org/</a>.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"known-issues\" class=\"collapsible\">Known issues</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li>On Windows 10 before 1703, or when Developer Mode is turned off, special permissions are required when cloning repositories with symbolic links, therefore support for symbolic links is disabled by default. Use <code>git clone -c core.symlinks=true &lt;URL&gt;</code> to enable it, see details <a href=\"https://gitforwindows.org/symbolic-links\">here</a>.</li>\n<li>If configured to use Plink, you will have to connect with <a href=\"http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/\">putty</a> first and accept the host key.</li>\n<li>Some console programs, most notably non-MSYS2 Python, PHP, Node and OpenSSL, interact correctly with MinTTY only when called through <code>winpty</code> (e.g. the Python console needs to be started as <code>winpty python</code> instead of just <code>python</code>).</li>\n<li><p>If you specify command-line options starting with a slash, POSIX-to-Windows path conversion will kick in converting e.g. \"<code>/usr/bin/bash.exe</code>\" to \"<code>C:\\Program Files\\Git\\usr\\bin\\bash.exe</code>\". When that is not desired -- e.g. \"<code>--upload-pack=/opt/git/bin/git-upload-pack</code>\" or \"<code>-L/regex/</code>\" -- you need to set the environment variable <code>MSYS_NO_PATHCONV</code> temporarily, like so:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><code>MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 git blame -L/pathconv/ msys2_path_conv.cc</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can double the first slash to avoid POSIX-to-Windows path conversion, e.g. \"<code>//usr/bin/bash.exe</code>\".</p></li>\n<li>Windows drives are normally recognized within the POSIX path as <code>/c/path/to/dir/</code> where <code>/c/</code> (or appropriate drive letter) is equivalent to the <code>C:\\</code> Windows prefix to the <code>\\path\\to\\dir</code>. If this is not recognized, revert to the <code>C:\\path\\to\\dir</code> Windows style.</li>\n<li>Git for Windows will not allow commits containing DOS-style truncated 8.3-format filenames ending with a tilde and digit, such as <code>mydocu~1.txt</code>. A workaround is to call <code>git config core.protectNTFS false</code>, which is not advised. Instead, add a rule to .gitignore to ignore the file(s), or rename the file(s).</li>\n<li>Many Windows programs (including the Windows Explorer) have problems with directory trees nested so deeply that the absolute path is longer than 260 characters. Therefore, Git for Windows refuses to check out such files by default. You can overrule this default by setting <code>core.longPaths</code>, e.g. <code>git clone -c core.longPaths=true ...</code>.</li>\n<li>Some commands are not yet supported on Windows and excluded from the installation.</li>\n<li>As Git for Windows is shipped without Python support, <code>git p4</code> (which is backed by a Python script) is not supported.</li>\n<li>The Quick Launch icon will only be installed for the user running setup (typically the Administrator). This is a technical restriction and will not change.</li>\n<li>Git command hints are designed for a POSIX shell, this can lead to issues when using them <strong>as is</strong> in non-POSIX shells like PowerShell, <a href=\"https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/2785\">as is the case in this ticket</a>.</li>\n<li>When pushing via the <code>git://</code> protocol, Git for Windows may hang indefinitely. The last console output in this case is typically <code>Writing objects: 100%</code>. As a workaround, disabling side-band via <code>git config sendpack.sideband false</code> should address this, at the cost of showing remote errors late (or not at all). No one is working on this; for more details, or to contribute a fix, see issue <a href=\"https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/907\">#907</a> (closed unless/until there is activity).</li>\n<li><p>Git for Windows executables linked to <code>msys-2.0.dll</code> are not compatible with Mandatory ASLR and may crash if system-wide Mandatory ASLR is enabled in Windows Exploit protection. A workaround is to disable ASLR for all executables in <code>C:\\Program Files\\Git\\usr\\bin</code>, run in administrator powershell (replace <code>$_.Name</code> with <code>$_</code> to use full path to executable instead of name):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><code>Get-Item -Path \"C:\\Program Files\\Git\\usr\\bin\\*.exe\" | %{ Set-ProcessMitigation -Name $_.Name -Disable ForceRelocateImages }</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can disable Mandatory ASLR completely in Windows Exploit protection.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Should you encounter other problems, please first search <a href=\"https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues\">the bug tracker</a> (also look at the closed issues) and <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/git-for-windows\">the mailing list</a>, chances are that the problem was reported already. Also make sure that you use an up to date Git for Windows version (or a <a href=\"https://gitforwindows.org/git-snapshots/\">current snapshot build</a>). If it has not been reported yet, please follow <a href=\"https://gitforwindows.org/issue-reporting-guidelines\">our bug reporting guidelines</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/new\">report the bug</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"licenses\" class=\"collapsible\">Licenses</h2><div>\n\n<p>Git is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2.</p>\n\n<p>Git for Windows is distributed with other components yet, such as Bash, zlib, curl, tcl/tk, perl, MSYS2.

This was fixed by merging Git's topic branch <a href=\"https://github.com/gitgitgadget/git/commits/sg/line-log-boundary-fixes\"><code>sg/line-log-boundary-fixes</code></a>.</li>\n<li>A broken or malicious <code>git fetch</code> can say that it has the same object for many many times, and the upload-pack serving it can exhaust memory storing them redundantly, which has been corrected. This was fixed by merging Git's topic branch <a href=\"https://github.com/gitgitgadget/git/commits/ps/upload-pack-oom-protection\"><code>ps/upload-pack-oom-protection</code></a>.</li>\n<li>Fixes multiple crashes around midx write-out codepaths.

This was fixed by merging Git's topic branch <a href=\"https://github.com/gitgitgadget/git/commits/jk/fetch-check-graph-objects-fix\"><code>jk/fetch-check-graph-objects-fix</code></a>.</li>\n<li>Various options to <code>git diff</code> that makes comparison ignore certain aspects of the differences (like \"space changes are ignored\", \"differences in lines that match these regular expressions are ignored\") did not work well with <code>--name-only</code> and friends. This was fixed by merging Git's topic branch <a href=\"https://github.com/gitgitgadget/git/commits/ly/diff-name-only-with-diff-from-content\"><code>ly/diff-name-only-with-diff-from-content</code></a>.</li>\n<li><code>git diff --no-index</code> run inside a subdirectory under control of a Git repository operated at the top of the working tree and stripped the prefix from the output, and oddballs like \"-\" (stdin) did not work correctly because of it.  Correct the set-up by undoing what the set-up sequence did to the current working directory and prefix.

This was fixed by merging Git's topic branch <a href=\"https://github.com/gitgitgadget/git/commits/en/ort-rename-fixes\"><code>en/ort-rename-fixes</code></a>.</li>\n<li><code>git push</code> had a code path that led to <code>BUG()</code> but it should have reported a regular failure, as it is a response to a usual but invalid end-user action to attempt pushing an object that does not exist. This was fixed by merging Git's topic branch <a href=\"https://github.com/gitgitgadget/git/commits/dl/push-missing-object-error\"><code>dl/push-missing-object-error</code></a>.</li>\n<li><code>git refs migrate</code> to migrate the reflog entries from a refs  backend to another had a handful of bugs squashed.

When writing a config entry, values with a trailing CR are not quoted, causing the CR to be lost when the config is later read.  When initializing a submodule, if the submodule path contains a trailing CR, the altered path is read resulting in the submodule being checked out to an incorrect location.

The Git client does not perform sufficient validation of the advertised bundles, which allows the remote side to perform protocol injection.

If the source repository is owned by a different user, then those\nhardlinked files may be rewritten at any point in time by the untrusted user.</li>\n<li><strong>CVE-2024-32021</strong>: When cloning a local source repository that contains symlinks\nvia the filesystem, Git may create hardlinks to arbitrary user-readable files\non the same filesystem as the target repository in the objects/ directory.</li>\n<li><strong>CVE-2024-32465</strong>: It is supposed to be safe to clone untrusted repositories,\neven those unpacked from zip archives or tarballs originating from untrusted\nsources, but Git can be tricked to run arbitrary code as part of the clone.</li>\n<li>Defense-in-depth: submodule: require the submodule path to contain\ndirectories only.</li>\n<li>Defense-in-depth: clone: when symbolic links collide with directories, keep\nthe latter.</li>\n<li>Defense-in-depth: clone: prevent hooks from running during a clone.</li>\n<li>Defense-in-depth: core.hooksPath: add some protection while cloning.</li>\n<li>Defense-in-depth: fsck: warn about symlink pointing inside a gitdir.</li>\n<li>Various fix-ups on HTTP tests.</li>\n<li>HTTP Header redaction code has been adjusted for a newer version of cURL\nlibrary that shows its traces differently from earlier versions.</li>\n<li>Fix was added to work around a regression in libcURL 8.7.0 (which has already\nbeen fixed in their tip of the tree).</li>\n<li>Replace macos-12 used at GitHub CI with macos-13.</li>\n<li>ci(linux-asan/linux-ubsan): let's save some time</li>\n<li>Tests with LSan from time to time seem to emit

symbolic links by using reparse points when available.  For technical reasons, this only works for symbolic links pointing to files, not directories.</li>\n<li>A lot of work has been put into making it possible to compile Git's source code (the part written in C, of course, not the scripts) with Microsoft Visual Studio.

The release notes covering the history of the core git commands can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/git/git/tree/HEAD/Documentation/RelNotes\">in the Git project</a>.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://git-scm.com/\">http://git-scm.com/</a> for further details about Git including ports to other operating systems. Git for Windows is hosted at <a href=\"https://gitforwindows.org/\">https://gitforwindows.org/</a>.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"known-issues\" class=\"collapsible\">Known issues</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li>On Windows 10 before 1703, or when Developer Mode is turned off, special permissions are required when cloning repositories with symbolic links, therefore support for symbolic links is disabled by default. Use <code>git clone -c core.symlinks=true &lt;URL&gt;</code> to enable it, see details <a href=\"https://gitforwindows.org/symbolic-links\">here</a>.</li>\n<li>If configured to use Plink, you will have to connect with <a href=\"http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/\">putty</a> first and accept the host key.</li>\n<li>Some console programs, most notably non-MSYS2 Python, PHP, Node and OpenSSL, interact correctly with MinTTY only when called through <code>winpty</code> (e.g. the Python console needs to be started as <code>winpty python</code> instead of just <code>python</code>).</li>\n<li><p>If you specify command-line options starting with a slash, POSIX-to-Windows path conversion will kick in converting e.g. \"<code>/usr/bin/bash.exe</code>\" to \"<code>C:\\Program Files\\Git\\usr\\bin\\bash.exe</code>\". When that is not desired -- e.g. \"<code>--upload-pack=/opt/git/bin/git-upload-pack</code>\" or \"<code>-L/regex/</code>\" -- you need to set the environment variable <code>MSYS_NO_PATHCONV</code> temporarily, like so:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><code>MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 git blame -L/pathconv/ msys2_path_conv.cc</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can double the first slash to avoid POSIX-to-Windows path conversion, e.g. \"<code>//usr/bin/bash.exe</code>\".</p></li>\n<li>Windows drives are normally recognized within the POSIX path as <code>/c/path/to/dir/</code> where <code>/c/</code> (or appropriate drive letter) is equivalent to the <code>C:\\</code> Windows prefix to the <code>\\path\\to\\dir</code>. If this is not recognized, revert to the <code>C:\\path\\to\\dir</code> Windows style.</li>\n<li>Git for Windows will not allow commits containing DOS-style truncated 8.3-format filenames ending with a tilde and digit, such as <code>mydocu~1.txt</code>. A workaround is to call <code>git config core.protectNTFS false</code>, which is not advised. Instead, add a rule to .gitignore to ignore the file(s), or rename the file(s).</li>\n<li>Many Windows programs (including the Windows Explorer) have problems with directory trees nested so deeply that the absolute path is longer than 260 characters. Therefore, Git for Windows refuses to check out such files by default. You can overrule this default by setting <code>core.longPaths</code>, e.g. <code>git clone -c core.longPaths=true ...</code>.</li>\n<li>Some commands are not yet supported on Windows and excluded from the installation.</li>\n<li>As Git for Windows is shipped without Python support, <code>git p4</code> (which is backed by a Python script) is not supported.</li>\n<li>The Quick Launch icon will only be installed for the user running setup (typically the Administrator). This is a technical restriction and will not change.</li>\n<li>Git command hints are designed for a POSIX shell, this can lead to issues when using them <strong>as is</strong> in non-POSIX shells like PowerShell, <a href=\"https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/2785\">as is the case in this ticket</a>.</li>\n<li>When pushing via the <code>git://</code> protocol, Git for Windows may hang indefinitely. The last console output in this case is typically <code>Writing objects: 100%</code>. As a workaround, disabling side-band via <code>git config sendpack.sideband false</code> should address this, at the cost of showing remote errors late (or not at all). No one is working on this; for more details, or to contribute a fix, see issue <a href=\"https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/907\">#907</a> (closed unless/until there is activity).</li>\n<li><p>Git for Windows executables linked to <code>msys-2.0.dll</code> are not compatible with Mandatory ASLR and may crash if system-wide Mandatory ASLR is enabled in Windows Exploit protection. A workaround is to disable ASLR for all executables in <code>C:\\Program Files\\Git\\usr\\bin</code>, run in administrator powershell (replace <code>$_.Name</code> with <code>$_</code> to use full path to executable instead of name):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><code>Get-Item -Path \"C:\\Program Files\\Git\\usr\\bin\\*.exe\" | %{ Set-ProcessMitigation -Name $_.Name -Disable ForceRelocateImages }</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can disable Mandatory ASLR completely in Windows Exploit protection.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Should you encounter other problems, please first search <a href=\"https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues\">the bug tracker</a> (also look at the closed issues) and <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/git-for-windows\">the mailing list</a>, chances are that the problem was reported already.

When initializing a submodule, if the submodule path contains a trailing CR, the altered path is read resulting in the submodule being checked out to an incorrect location.

If the source repository is owned by a different user, then those\nhardlinked files may be rewritten at any point in time by the untrusted user.</li>\n<li><strong>CVE-2024-32021</strong>: When cloning a local source repository that contains symlinks\nvia the filesystem, Git may create hardlinks to arbitrary user-readable files\non the same filesystem as the target repository in the objects/ directory.</li>\n<li><strong>CVE-2024-32465</strong>: It is supposed to be safe to clone untrusted repositories,\neven those unpacked from zip archives or tarballs originating from untrusted\nsources, but Git can be tricked to run arbitrary code as part of the clone.</li>\n<li>Defense-in-depth: submodule: require the submodule path to contain\ndirectories only.</li>\n<li>Defense-in-depth: clone: when symbolic links collide with directories, keep\nthe latter.</li>\n<li>Defense-in-depth: clone: prevent hooks from running during a clone.</li>\n<li>Defense-in-depth: core.hooksPath: add some protection while cloning.</li>\n<li>Defense-in-depth: fsck: warn about symlink pointing inside a gitdir.</li>\n<li>Various fix-ups on HTTP tests.</li>\n<li>HTTP Header redaction code has been adjusted for a newer version of cURL\nlibrary that shows its traces differently from earlier versions.</li>\n<li>Fix was added to work around a regression in libcURL 8.7.0 (which has already\nbeen fixed in their tip of the tree).</li>\n<li>Replace macos-12 used at GitHub CI with macos-13.</li>\n<li>ci(linux-asan/linux-ubsan): let's save some time</li>\n<li>Tests with LSan from time to time seem to emit
